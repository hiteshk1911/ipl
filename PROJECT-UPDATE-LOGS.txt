25th Jan 2026 – IPL Cricket Analytics Platform: Current State
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

📊 Project Status Update — IPL Analytics Platform
1. Overview

We are building a professional-grade cricket analytics platform focused on IPL ball-by-ball data.
The goal is to create explainable, decision-ready intelligence for teams, coaches, analysts, and boards — not fantasy or fan-level statistics.

The core philosophy so far has been:

Get the data model right

Build trustworthy analytics primitives

Delay UI/ML until intelligence is solid

2. Current State of the System
Data Ingestion & Storage

Raw IPL JSON data is ingested at ball-by-ball (delivery) level

Historical schema inconsistencies (season formats, match IDs, missing fields) are normalized at ingestion

Delivery events are stored with:

Legal vs illegal balls

Over, ball, delivery sequence

Match, season, venue

Batter, bowler, non-striker

Phase (powerplay / middle / death)

The ingestion pipeline is:

Idempotent (safe to re-run)

Relationally consistent (players, matches, deliveries)

Cricket-correct (no silent data loss)

Data Scale (Currently Ingested)
Season	Matches	Deliveries
2007/08	58	13,489
2009	57	13,606
2011	73	17,013

This gives us a multi-season longitudinal dataset, sufficient for serious analysis.

3. Analytics Layer (Core Product)

We have built a dedicated analytics layer on top of raw deliveries using SQL views.

Key Analytics Surfaces
1. Batter Profile (Career-Wide)

Matches played

Runs, balls, outs

Average and strike rate

Phase-wise performance

Dismissal breakdown (caught, bowled, LBW, stumped)

2. Batter Profile — Season-Aware

One row per (batter, season)

Enables year-on-year comparison

Prevents accidental mixing of seasons

Foundation for trend and evolution analysis

Example use case:

Detect decline vs improvement

Identify role changes over time

Separate one bad season from structural weakness

4. Proven Capability (What the System Can Already Do)

Using the current setup, we can already generate coach- and selector-grade insights, such as:

Batter career trajectory across seasons

Phase-specific strengths and weaknesses

How a batter typically gets out (technical vs risk-based)

Role evolution (e.g., powerplay aggressor → middle-overs anchor)

Early signals of decline or improvement

A real example analysis (SC Ganguly) clearly demonstrated:

Peak effectiveness in 2007/08

Sharp decline in 2009

Loss of powerplay and finishing impact

Persistent dismissal pattern (caught-heavy → aerial risk)

These insights are:

Explainable

Reproducible

Season-aware

Based on ball-level truth

5. What the Product Looks Like Today

At this stage, the product is not a UI-heavy app.
It is best described as:

A cricket intelligence engine built on a clean event store and explainable analytics.

Architecture Layers

Raw Data Layer

Immutable delivery events

Never directly consumed by end users

Analytics Layer (Main Product)

SQL views encoding cricket logic

Batter profiles, season splits, phase analysis

Interpretation Layer (Emerging)

Trend detection

Role identification

Comparative context

This separation ensures correctness first, polish later.

6. Why This Foundation Is Strong

Correct cricket modeling (rarely done well)

Season-safe analytics (critical for professional use)

No black-box metrics

Every number can be explained to a coach or selector

Easy to extend without reworking fundamentals

This already places the system ahead of most public cricket analytics tools.

7. Planned Evolution (Clear Roadmap)
Phase 1: Complete Batter Intelligence (Next)

Automated trend flags (improving / declining / stable)

League-average comparisons

Pressure & clutch indicators

Bowler-specific weaknesses

Phase 2: Expand Dimensions

Bowler intelligence profiles

Batter–bowler matchup maps

Venue-adjusted performance

Opposition-specific analysis

Phase 3: Productization

Materialized views for performance

Clean API contracts

Lightweight dashboards / reports

Shareable outputs for teams

Phase 4: Advanced (Optional)

Aging curves

Role clustering

ML-assisted pattern discovery
(only after intelligence layer is mature)

8. Summary

We have successfully built the hardest part of a cricket analytics product:

A clean, trusted, multi-season event store

An analytics layer that produces real insight, not just stats

The system is now ready to:

Scale across more seasons

Add deeper intelligence

Be productized confidently

Next focus: turning existing analytics into faster signals and comparisons rather than adding new raw data.
